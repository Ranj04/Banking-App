# Final Project

## Overview
In teams of 3-4 members, enhance the hw2/react fullstack template to add 1 new feature per team member. Each team member to add 1 new additional feature. Coordinate so that the new features fit around a theme, and 2 people don't add the same feature. Large features can be split up between members. For example a contacts list feature may be composed of 2 endpoints, 1 to add a contact, and 1 to list contacts.

Please avoid force push (git push -f)! It can delete other student's commits.

Sample ideas:
- Contacts list
- Credit feature
- Send direct message
- public feed

### Requirements
- Add 1 new endpoint
- Modify front end to use new endpoint
- Merge all code to main branch
- Each member must submit commits for their own feature from their own account.

Each team member will have their own score.

### Scoring
- Does Feature work
- Are edge cases handled? (Think of what happens in common edge cases)
- Is work merged to main branch
